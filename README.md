# Welcome to the Code_Jams front-end repository!

# What is Code_Jams?
### Code_Jams is a will be an online Q&A forum for anyone having tech troubles of any kind.
It is currently being developed by me, and one of my friends is helping me with the designing.

#### I suck at front-end development...
Which is why I am making this repository! If you would like to contribute any front-end code, such as:  
1. Styles
2. Layouts
3. JavaScript
4. Or completly new functionality...  

just fork this repo and make a pull-request! I will review your pull-request and if I approve of the new code, I will merge it.  

# Front-end code only please! No back-end code will be accepted.
